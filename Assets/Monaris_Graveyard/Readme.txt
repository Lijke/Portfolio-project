Stylized Graveyard v1.0
------------------------------------

	the prefabs in the "nature" folder use materials that use custom shaders.
	If the materials don't work in your Unity version, you can replace them with materials based on standard shaders.


	The sky I used in the trailer production can be downloaded for FREE from the Asset Store.
